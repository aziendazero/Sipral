Update to release 2.2.2 introduce following improvement:
 - Process Manager speedup, using mememory instead of jbpm db. 
 - HBS tree speedup, cleaning code and selectable HBS code system from seam properties
 - log improvement
 
Update from phi project template following files:
 - js.js, web.xml, components.xml, home.xhtml, login.xhtml, faces-config.xml and update js scripts

Remove from <jboss>/server/<serverName>/deploy-apps/CATALOG_SERVER.ear/ the file hibernate.cfg.xml. It was used for jbpm persistence config. 

Updated HBS Manager: take domain and codes of HBS from seam properties: 
	SDLOC_ROOT_DOMAIN=PHI_HOSPITAL_BREAKDOWN_STRUCTURE
	SDLOC_ROOT_CODE=HBSROOT

	Check current SDL with following query:
		select internal_id,creation_date, sdl.name_giv, cv.code as Sdl_ClassCode, cv2.code as Sdl_Code, sdl.class_code,  sdl.code from service_delivery_location sdl
			left join code_value cv on cv.id = sdl.class_code
			left join code_value cv2 on cv2.id = sdl.code;

	update service_Delivery_Location 
      set code = (select id from code_value where code='HBSROOT')
      where code = (select id from code_value where code='HBSSDLRT')
    ;
    commit;
    
	Be sure to have only one SDL with code HBSROOT.
